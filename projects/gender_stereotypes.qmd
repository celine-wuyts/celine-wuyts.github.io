title: "Gender-ability stereotypes"
subtitle: "A survey of secondary school students in Kayonza District, Rwanda"
---

## Background

Gender stereotypes influence girls' self-beliefs and interests, which in turn shape their academic performance as well as their further education and career choices. 

Most of the recently published studies on gender-ability stereotypes have been conducted in WEIRD (Western, educated, industrial, rich, and democratic) populations. 

Using data from a survey of secondary school students in Kayonza District, Rwanda (2021), we examine gender-ability stereotype endorsements in math, ICT and languages, and the causes and consequences of these beliefs, among adolescents in Rwanda.

## Research questions

1. To what extent do secondary-school students in Rwanda endorse gender-ability stereotypes? At what age do male and female adolescents' in-group superiority beliefs shift towards gender stereotypical beliefs about abilities? 

2. How do gender-ability stereotypes affect self-concept beliefs and schooling preferences?

3. Are the observed patterns robust to controlling for socially desirable responding?
