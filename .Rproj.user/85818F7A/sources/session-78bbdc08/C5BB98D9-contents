## Abstract

Traditionally, surveys have used binary gender questions (male/female) based on biological sex, which can perpetuate gender biases and inequalities by not acknowledging the diversity and fluidity of gender identities. This research aims to investigate how binary versus continuous gender measurement instruments affect people's beliefs about gender and attitudes towards gender equality. I conducted an original survey experiment with a sample of United States residents. The experiment involved manipulating the measurement scale of gender questions, using either binary gender identity or continuous gender identity-expression.

## Research questions

1. How are beliefs in binary gender related to attitudes towards gender equality?

2. Does the way in which gender is measured affect reported gender beliefs and attitudes?

3. What are the measurement properties and predictive value of the proposed gradational gender measurement instrument as opposed to a classic binary gender question?
